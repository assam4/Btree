# Btree

The Sorted_Btree data structure is a prototype created similar to AVL trees ․
The structure can store any data type that supports comparison operators. (Мerification of implementation of concepts (c++20))

OOP and STL paradigms are used for implementation .


This is a prototype of a real Btree so there is room for improvements and the tree logic can be broken by excessive default input for a certain type.
